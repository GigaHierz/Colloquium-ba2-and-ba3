        <h2>1. What does a community offer and what does it ask for?</h2>
        <span>
          <p>
            The term community stems from ‘common’, already signalizing, that a
            community is built on something that is shared among a group of
            people; may it be interests, beliefs, goals, background, experience,
            etc. In a large group, like the dance community in Berlin, the
            uniting factors are often hard to find, making the trial to enter
            the community an opportunity for traumatic or isolated experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a community is established, however, it can create a sense of
            belonging for the people inside. The more the members of the
            community have in common the stronger, safer, and more empowering it
            gets. Therefore it is good to have smaller communities to
            communicate certain things, needs, experiences, and ideas. Then you
            will be able to open up to the bigger community. It should be
            possible to fluctuate between those communities according to your
            needs, and for the big community then to listen to their sub-groups
            (smaller communities) to be able to support and further the
            information with their power politically, within bigger
            institutions, and the outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Communities can be a place where an exchange of ideas, resources and
            information is usually accessible to not only longstanding members
            of the community but also new people coming from different cities or
            professions. Ideally then, the wide range of know-how, resources,
            funding opportunities, publicity, background, and financial support
            by the government, creates a breeding ground for shared learning,
            support and ideally even rest. People with larger public platforms
            can use that resource to support new or young artists. We can look
            for and find collaborators within the community, rather than
            reaching out to other cities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuation is one of the essentials in a community (continuous
            projects, meetings, events, etc.). The community needs to have a
            shared vision, or as previously mentioned, some uniting factor that
            people feel nourished by. These commonalities lay the ground for
            mutual support, empowerment and accountability. These agreed-on
            factors will have to also be flexible, breathable, and well
            communicated to, one, not create a toxic environment through
            generalization, and, two, prevent further marginalization and
            tokenization of parts of the community.
          </p>
        </span>

      <div class="text text2">
        <h2>2. How does the community correspond with the people outside?</h2>
        <span>
          <p>
            We are asking this question in reflection to people who arrive as
            new members of the community, new visitors of performances and
            classes, and neighbors who surround the institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            New members of our dance community could be invited by experienced
            performers, dramaturges in a tandem way (for example:
            https://www.tanzraumberlin.de/tanzbuero/tandem/).
          </p>
          <p>
            Former arrivers who are now integrated in the community will have
            the lived experience, knowledge of what makes it easier to arrive.
            Another way of introducing yourself in the dance scene can be
            through platforms, websites, festivals that give space for
            presentation, support, workshops.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visitors of Performances who don’t have the knowledge or people to
            join the events can get to know each other or other interested
            visitors in small pre workshops before a performance, discussion
            rounds. Guides or an introduction before a performance can help to
            make visitors feel safer. (Tanzbüro is trying this on this platform:
            https://www.tanzraumberlin.de/tanzbuero/mapping-dance-berlin/)
          </p>
          <p>
            To introduce neighbors into your space is an even more difficult
            question because they do not necessarily have an interest or a need
            for what you offer, it may even disturb them in the way that some
            institutions are also part of gentrification processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I personally think that it needs an openness to listen to neighbors
            and their needs and interests and to include them in an honest
            interaction. Otherwise, it will not be a safe space for the
            neighbors/participants to enter and participate in a respectful and
            mutual way.
          </p>

            Uferstudios has tried different things in their festival “Ausufern”
            (https://www.uferstudios.com/projekte/ausufern/) to get in contact
            with the Wedding that is surrounding them.

          4. Is the community encouraging and supporting diversity within it?
        </h2>
        <span>
          <p class="quote">
            “I have a hard time accepting diversity as a synonym for justice.
            Diversity is a corporate strategy. It’s a strategy designed to
            ensure that the institution functions in the same way that it
            functioned before, except now that you now have some black faces and
            brown faces. It’s a difference that doesn’t make a difference,”
            Angela Davis
          </p>
          <p>
            A dance community is moving in a gray zone. There are institutions
            that see themselves as part of the community, where diversity needs
            to be implemented and enforced through structural changes.
            Especially the regularly state-funded institutions within the
            community are built on archaic foundations that are a breeding
            ground for exclusion, toxicity, and tokenization. Diversity does not
            end with having international dancers. Who are the leaders of these
            institutions? Which dance form is getting the regular funding? Who
            is profiting ? What structures in education and work are seen as
            successful and worth funding?
          </p>
          <p>
            A large part of the dance community, though, is not routinely part
            of these institutions, which is where self-accountability and
            holding each other accountable becomes a major part of the work
            within the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            In what I would call a mainstream contemporary dance technique
            education in Europe, you will learn to copy as many styles as
            possible in perfection to survive and be versatile on the market.
            With this, the acknowledgement and appreciation of the history of
            dance styles, especially in Non-Western cultural-heritage, gets
            often deleted and disrespected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, these approaches go hand in hand and will influence each
            other, but part of being in a community is listening to people with
            entirely different (lived) experiences and being open to the
            uncomfortable conversations that can come to the surface. As in any
            community, privileges play a huge part in our experiences, and if
            there is no open dialogue about these topics, there is no true
            community, but just further separation from one another.

        <h2>5. How to deconstruct hierarchies in dance styles?</h2>
        <span>
          <p>
            Dance-Styles as we call it here come with their intersectional
            history of culture, race, class, gender and sexuality. And those
            politics don’t just disappear when we talk about art, they are very
            present and affect funding and education.
          </p>
          <p>
            They affect where, how and when you can earn a living with dance and
            choreography. The most important step is to acknowledge the
            influence and history and stop putting again and again only people
            up on the highest positions who come from a western, heteronormative
            dance background like ballet.

        <h2>
          6. Why is there a lack of confidence in the work students and artists
          do in the network?
        </h2>
        <span>
          <p>
            Often, especially in art, support and solidarity come under the
            caveat of subjective liking and taste of what is produced or what
            the other is part of. This can result in neglecting parts of the
            community and further separation within it.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a lack of honest and altruistic initiations. Feedbacking
            and Criticism morphed into controversial, even taboo topics. In some
            cases, art is seen more and more as a business, rather than a healer
            or an integral part of the system that feeds the multicultural,
            progressive, alternative Berlin. When genuine respect and
            appreciation in the artform is missing (and is being replaced by
            appreciation of names and status), the confidence inside the
            community will be lacking as well.

          7. How do we support confidence and empathy within each other inside
          the community?
        </h2>
        <span>
          <p>
            In an ideal world, we could find a way to celebrate the achievements
            of people inside the community, regardless of opinions based on
            personal taste or what we see as ‘valuable’. When we decipher our
            own personal sense of the difference between judgment and
            constructive criticism and are clearly able to communicate that to
            fellow artists; when we listen to each other's needs when peers
            communicate their boundaries of criticism, would we be able to
            create a safe space for creation and growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feeling supported through the presence of other members of the
            community and, if needed, getting constructive feedback (which is
            always a sign of engagement and professionalism, regardless of
            liking something or not), is a good start to build the confidence to
            continue and do the same for someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            If funding would be distributed in a way that would create platforms
            directed and organized by different levels inside the community,
            inclusive and proactive, rather than formal and exclusive and with a
            narrow comfort in the known artist only, or their friends, we could
            achieve proposing a variety of styles, qualities, and decentralized
            points of view in art. Educate the community and, at the same time,
            educate the ones that are in power in what the community is lacking
            or suffering from.

        <h2>8. What is our role and responsibility as artists?</h2>
        <span>
          <p>
            With all the crises we are confronted with as a world today, art is
            needed more than ever. Start being an artist every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the frame of the institution, start learning how to gather
            yourself with authenticity and firmness. Lead with certainty,
            spontaneous joy, and plenitude and stop being judgmental towards
            others, understand it is a much bigger picture than the one you
            allocate yourself as an artist. Don't wait until graduation or until
            a company hires you to activate your colleagues and peers' sense of
            responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feedback each other with generosity and tolerance towards
            differences. Feed your intellect and vision without degrading
            others’ intellect and vision. We can value different approaches or
            unique ways of understanding in all kinds of educational and
            professional settings, and learn about them without having to agree
            and adopt them for the rest of our practice. There is a level of
            maturity needed to handle other people's points of view, to listen
            to (actual) constructive criticism and not only react to it. In
            educational situations, part of the responsibility lies in the
            students to keep the environment safe and when individual
            resistances to the approaches occur to not let it influence the
            energy, learning environment and togetherness of the whole group. At
            the same time, the teachers need to confront the group with
            flexibility and openness toward the individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way of teaching, learning or working with each other, is to
            acknowledge the past of the person who is learning from you, to give
            space to their way of doing their art and finding a way to grow
            without diminishing each other. To be open to take advice without
            putting yourself down or forgetting what you want to express, to
            have the ability to grow with critique and see mistakes or being
            lost, as a helpful tool to grow and to acknowledge your individual
            pass. To see art, performance, etc. as a way of expression that will
            connect and teach not only you, but all participants; an expression
            that has an importance and duty only art can have.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are moving in a community where, because of its wide and
            subjective character, the experiences people make are often polar
            opposite. While people can experience a resistance toward using
            physicality and certain trained technical backgrounds, people also
            experience feeling excluded from the community because of a lack of
            training. Similar struggles are discovered in narrative approaches
            or didactic approaches to pieces. It all comes back to respecting
            one another and not jumping to destructive conclusions and
            judgements, because this will always create divisions within the
            group. Judgment is disturbing, categorization dividing us.
